# ML&DL_Model_of_Detecting_Different_Types_of_CAN_Attack
This repo contains a full code implementation of different types of CAN attack detection.

Controller Area Network (CAN) is the standard protocol for the in-vehicle network. The lack of security features in the CAN protocol makes vehicles vulnerable to attacks. The message injection attack is a representative attack type which injects fabricated messages to deceive electronic control unit (ECUs) or cause malfunctions. Therefore, ML and DL models are developed to detect different types of CAN attacks and protect vehicle networks.
